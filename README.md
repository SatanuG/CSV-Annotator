# CSV Annotator
 Python script to create a window containing tweets from the csv file and easy accessible buttons and drop-down menu for sentiment annotation.
 
 The first menu screen enables the users to resume the work from where they left.
 
 
The second menu screen is the annotation window where the user can choose the sentiment from the radio buttons and the confidence from the drop down menu. There are 3 buttons in this window. From the left the first button is EXIT and on pressing this button the window will close and save your annotations to a new csv file with the tweet text and id. The save will only happen if you have forgot to press the Save Progress button. The Save Progress button saves your progress and the Next button takes you to the next tweet.
 
 
 
 On clicking on exit a Message Box appears with the ID of the last annotated tweet.
